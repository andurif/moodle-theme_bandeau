// as the directory name for our theme.

// This setting list the style sheets we want to include in our theme. Because we want to use SCSS instead of CSS - we won't
// list any style sheets. If we did we would list the name of a file in the /style/ folder for our theme without any css file
// extensions.

// This is a setting that can be used to provide some styling to the content in the TinyMCE text editor. This is no longer the

// as the previous setting - listing a file in the /styles/ folder.

// This is a critical setting. We want to inherit from theme_boost because it provides a great starting point for SCSS bootstrap4

// styles and mustache templates and some (not all) settings.
